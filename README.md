# 3-tier-application

This an implementation of a distributed monitoring system that is used in a mega-city to control traffic in the streets. It consists of a set of sensors, surveillance cameras, electronic traffic signs, in addition to a set of computers each of them is responsible for an
area in the city. It has also a set of servers that collect the requests from the computers and process
them based on a global view of the traffic in the whole city. These servers provide the reply in terms
of a set of recommendations to the computers, where they, in turn, send these recommendations to
the drivers in the streets. The recommendations mainly provide guidelines for the state of the
different streets in the city and the best route for the driver to reach a specific point in the city.
